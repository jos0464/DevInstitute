Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately and completely solves all the problems and implements all functionalities described in the exercises. Each exercise from cats to zoo is correctly implemented using classes, objects, methods, and attributes as requested. The Zoo exercise also correctly implements the bonus with *args.
- readability: The code is highly readable due to clear comments, logical structure, and meaningful variable names. The use of whitespace and indentation enhances clarity.
- performance: The code demonstrates efficient performance with simple, direct implementations of the required functionalities. There are no unnecessary loops or complex operations that could degrade performance.
- security: The code does not involve any external input or potentially vulnerable operations, ensuring high security. No user input is taken, and there are no file operations or network communications that could introduce security risks.
