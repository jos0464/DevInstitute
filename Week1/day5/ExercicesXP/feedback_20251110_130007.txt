Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements both Challenge 1 (sorting comma-separated words) and Challenge 2 (finding the longest word in a sentence), as described in the chapter content. The expected outputs match the instructions.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear comments explaining each step.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given tasks, utilizing built-in Python functions for splitting, sorting, and joining strings.
- security: The code does not appear to have any security vulnerabilities. The input function is used safely and the string manipulations don't introduce any risks.
