Brief justification:
- correctness: The code perfectly implements all the required functions and program flow as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. Each function performs its specified task correctly, and the main loop functions as expected, handling user input and calling appropriate functions. The code also incorporates extra validation for negative prices, which addresses the first extra challenge.
- readability: The code is well-structured, with clear function definitions and comments explaining the purpose of each section. Variable names are descriptive, and the overall formatting is consistent, making the code easy to understand.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task. Dictionary operations (add, update, delete) are generally fast, and the program doesn't involve any computationally intensive operations that would significantly impact performance.
- security: The code includes basic input validation (checking for negative prices and handling potential `ValueError` when converting input to float), which contributes to its security by preventing unexpected behavior due to invalid user input. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the provided code.
